# VR-Baseball
<h2>Purpose</h2>
In real life, we are often limited by the availability of space for sports activities, especially for sports like baseball that require large fields. Therefore, we aim to create a VR baseball game that allows players to enjoy various game modes and scenarios in a virtual environment. We utilize the Unity Engine for developing our game environment and employ the Universal Render Pipeline for our rendering system. For VR integration, we utilize Unity's built-in XR toolkit package to implement features like projection, movement, rotation, and object interaction.
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
Pitching Machine Mode: In this mode, players can adjust the speed and direction of the pitch from the pitching machine. This helps players identify and improve their weaknesses. We use the CURVY SPLINE algorithm to simulate the flight trajectories of different types of pitches and adjust the force of the pitch to achieve various speeds.

Nine Square Grid Mode: In this mode, players can choose additional modes and scoring challenges to enhance the fun and challenge.
<h2>UI and UX Design</h2>
<strong>User Interface (UI) Design:</strong><br>
<strong>Main Menu Interface:</strong> Upon launching the game, players first see the main menu interface. This interface includes our game title (Virtual Baseball), buttons to start the game in either Nine Square Grid or Pitching Machine modes, a button for gameplay instructions, and settings options as described below. The menu background features images that fit the theme of the game.<br>
<strong>Settings Interface:</strong> After entering the game, pressing a specific button on the controller will bring up the settings interface two meters in front of the player's direction of view. This interface includes a volume adjustment slider bar, a brightness adjustment slider bar, a button to change the language, and a button to exit to the main menu.<br>
<strong>Nine Square Grid Interface:</strong> This interface displays the current and highest scores, a scene selection button, and mode buttons.<br>
<strong>Pitching Machine Interface:</strong> This interface features a slider bar to control the speed of the pitch, a scene selection button, and buttons for setting the curve of the pitch.<br>
<strong>User Experience (UX) Design:</strong><br>
<strong>Interactive Feedback:</strong> When players swing the bat, tactile and auditory feedback, such as vibration feedback and hitting sounds, are provided to enhance the realism and enjoyment of the game.<br>
<strong>Intuitive Operation:</strong> The Nine Square Grid and Pitching Machine interfaces are placed on billboards close to the player, which are visually appealing and do not obstruct the view. Since interfaces can be selected from a distance with the controller, this design is intuitive and easy to operate.<br>
<strong>Game Tutorial:</strong> The main menu interface offers text instructions for gameplay to help players understand how to play and the objectives of the game.<br>
<strong>Scoring Challenges:</strong> The Nine Square Grid mode includes scoring challenges of varying difficulty, providing players with ongoing goals and a sense of achievement. The interface displays the player's current score and the highest score in real-time.<br>
